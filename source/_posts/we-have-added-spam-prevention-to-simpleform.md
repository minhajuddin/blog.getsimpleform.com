Now you can prevent getting notified for spammy messages just by signing up for an https://akismet.com/ account and configuring it on simpleform. Say goodbye to Spam!

If you already have a simpleform account, go to the page `http://getsimpleform.com/forms/<your-api-key>/edit` and enter your akismet key, and change the name attribute of your input/textarea fields to message or content. That's it! you are all set.

## Update: The url to edit your akismet key has changed to `http://getsimpleform.com/forms/your-api-key/edit`
